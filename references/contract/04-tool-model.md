## 4. Tool model

### Bundle to server quick reference

Skills reference bundles by conceptual name; the actual MCP server name is in the `Server` column.

| Bundle name | Server | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `serena-symbol-toolkit` | `serena` | Symbol discovery, references, diagnostics, edits |
| `gitnexus-radar` | `gitnexus` | Optional graph radar for architecture/blast radius |
| `context7-docs` | `context7` | Library/framework documentation lookup |
| `brave-search` | `brave-search` | Open-web and news discovery |
| `firecrawl-extraction` | `firecrawl` | Known URL and local document extraction (default tier) |
| `firecrawl-extended` | `firecrawl` | Site maps and structured field extraction (conditional tier) |
| `firecrawl-deep` | `firecrawl` | Deep interaction and agent research (approval-gated tier) |
| `playwright-browser-operator` | `playwright` | Live browser/DOM/visual/e2e actions |

### Tool priority

Use the lightest reliable tool. Native local tools such as exact file reads, `rg`, `fd`/`fdfind`, `grep`, `find`, `jq`, and `bash` stay first for exact strings, manifests, prose, config, and commands. MCP bundles are available capabilities, not default context sources; activate them only when they close the next evidence gap. Native tools are not MCP bundles; skill files may name them separately when they are part of the workflow.

| Task shape | First choice | Then narrow with |
|---|---|---|
| Graph overview, architecture, blast radius, changed-scope validation | `gitnexus-radar` when indexed, fresh, target-aware | `serena-symbol-toolkit` |
| Exact symbol discovery, declarations, references, symbol edits | `serena-symbol-toolkit` | Native tools + `apply_patch` |
| Library/framework docs | `context7-docs` | `b-research` |
| Web/news/image discovery and unknown-URL source shortlisting | `brave-search` | `firecrawl-extraction` for source content |
| Known URL extraction | `firecrawl-extraction` | `firecrawl-extended`, then `firecrawl-deep` (approval) |
| Local document extraction | `firecrawl-extraction` (`firecrawl_parse`) | `firecrawl-extraction` (`firecrawl_scrape`) only if already hosted |
| Browser/DOM/visual/e2e live UI operation | `playwright-browser-operator` when installed and safety-gated | Existing repo scripts, supplied evidence, or `firecrawl-extraction` for known remote pages |

### Selective leverage by lane

Use deeper MCP guidance where it materially improves evidence quality or coordination, not as a blanket default:

- **High-ROI lanes:** `b-plan` for cross-module or route/tool/consumer scoping, `b-implement` for shared/exported-boundary changes or symbol-heavy edits, `b-review` for blast-radius and shared-risk inspection, `b-research` for external docs/facts, and `b-browser` for browser/DOM/visual evidence.
- **Native-first lanes:** small direct requests, one-file docs/config/prose edits, exact local string checks, obvious single-symbol edits, and ordinary git/status/diff inspection. Prefer `rg`, `fd`/`fdfind`, and `jq` when they are available and materially faster than broader fallbacks.
- **Escalation rule:** if local evidence already answers the next decision, do not add MCP calls just because the bundle exists.
- **Runtime readiness rule:** installers and runtime docs may explain what still needs user setup, but availability messaging does not justify auto-running onboarding, indexing, or other user-scope setup steps.

### Radar/hands boundary

GitNexus is optional radar; Serena is primary hands. GitNexus scopes graph risk, flows, routes, consumers, and cross-module impact. Serena confirms exact symbols, bodies, references, and performs symbol-aware edits.

### GitNexus freshness gate

Rely on GitNexus only when the repo is indexed, not stale, and the target file or symbol is represented. If unavailable, stale, unindexed, missing FTS, or missing the target, warn once and continue with Serena or native tools. If a GitNexus result references a file whose mtime is newer than the index timestamp, treat the result as stale. Stale graph output is not evidence.

### Tool selection rules

- Single-file or local-only task: skip GitNexus.
- Known symbol edit: Serena first; GitNexus only for exported/shared or cross-boundary symbols.
- Planning or review question with no shared/public boundary, process-flow uncertainty, or unfamiliar subsystem: stay native or Serena-first.
- Body-last symbol workflow: inspect overviews, declarations, diagnostics, or references before full symbol bodies; request bodies only when needed to decide or edit.
- Large unfamiliar area: one GitNexus pass to narrow, then Serena confirms.
- Do not use GitNexus and Serena in parallel on the same exact symbol hunt.
- Do not escalate to a second MCP when the first authoritative source already answered.
- Pick the cheapest discovery tool that closes the next question; there is no required ordering among Serena discovery tools.

### MCP bundles

Skills reference MCP bundles by name instead of repeating per-tool MCP lists. Native tools such as Glob/Grep/Read/Bash are not MCP bundles and may be listed separately in a skill when they are workflow requirements.

#### `serena-symbol-toolkit`

- **Server:** `serena`
- **Install source:** runtime-specific user-scope MCP templates use the Serena MCP server after the user installs and initializes Serena. Do not auto-run `serena setup`, `serena init`, hooks, onboarding, or memory writes from the b-agentic installer.
- **Session init:** once per session, only when symbol-aware work first becomes necessary: `check_onboarding_performed`, then `onboarding` if needed. If onboarding would require persistent memory writes during a review-only/no-mutation run, skip Serena unless symbol evidence is necessary; when it is necessary, ask before writing persistent memories and keep summaries free of secrets or private data.
- **Discovery:** `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_declaration`, `find_implementations`, `search_for_pattern`.
- **Verification:** `get_diagnostics_for_file`.
- **Edits:** `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`, `rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol`.
- **LSP caveat:** strong for TS/JS, Python, and similar; weak for Bash, YAML, Markdown, Lua, and many DSLs. Treat non-LSP renames/safe-deletes/diagnostics as **not authoritative**; widen verification.

#### `gitnexus-radar`

- **Server:** `gitnexus`
- **Install source:** default user-scope MCP template uses `gitnexus mcp` after the user installs GitNexus. Indexing, generated skills, hooks, root guidance writes, and `gitnexus setup` remain user-run steps outside the b-agentic installer. Avoid cold `npx` for the default MCP entry because GitNexus native dependency startup can exceed runtime MCP timeouts.
- **Role:** optional graph radar for scoping blast radius, route/consumer surfaces, or unfamiliar architecture.
- **Use only when** indexed, fresh, and the target is represented.
- **Never use for** symbol editing, exact-body inspection, or anything Serena can answer directly.

#### `context7-docs`

- **Server:** `context7`
- **Install source:** runtime-specific user-scope MCP templates use `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` with the runtime-appropriate API-key placeholder format. Interactive installs may write a user-provided concrete key to the active runtime's user-scope config. Context7 CLI + Skills setup remains a user-run alternative, not part of b-agentic install.
- **Tools:** `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs`.
- **Version pinning:** before querying, pin from manifests **and lockfiles** (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, etc.). In monorepos, use the closest workspace. Ask when versions conflict.
- **Fallback:** if Context7 cannot answer, prefer the library's own documentation URL pattern (e.g., `<library>.dev/docs/`) over generic web search.

#### `brave-search`

- **Server:** `brave-search`
- **Install source:** runtime-specific user-scope MCP templates use `bunx @brave/brave-search-mcp-server --transport stdio` and the runtime-appropriate API-key placeholder format. Interactive installs may write a user-provided concrete key to the active runtime's user-scope config.
- **Tools:** `brave_web_search`, plus `brave_news_search` for recency-sensitive questions and `brave_image_search` when visual evidence is material.
- **Role:** open-web discovery only. Use it to find unknown official URLs, recent advisories/release notes, and comparison sources, then pass discovered URLs to `firecrawl-extraction` when the final answer depends on page substance rather than result metadata.

#### `firecrawl-extraction` (default tier)

- **Server:** `firecrawl`
- **Install source:** runtime-specific user-scope MCP templates use `bunx firecrawl-mcp` and the runtime-appropriate API-key placeholder format. Interactive installs may write a user-provided concrete key to the active runtime's user-scope config.
- **Tools:** `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_parse`.
- **Use for:** content extraction from a known URL or local document.
- **Format selection:** for specific data points, fields, prices, API parameters, tables, or lists, prefer structured extraction or query over full markdown. Use full markdown only when full-page understanding, summarization, or quoted context is needed.

#### `firecrawl-extended` (conditional tier)

- **Tools:** `firecrawl_map`, `firecrawl_extract`.
- **Use only when** mapping a site's structure or extracting structured fields (prices, params, tables). Do not reach for these on plain content.

#### `firecrawl-deep` (last-resort tier, requires explicit user approval)

- **Tools:** `firecrawl_interact`, `firecrawl_agent`.
- **Cost warning:** can run for minutes and burn substantial credit. Exhaust lower tiers, then get approval per invocation by default. A user may grant a run-scoped, capped pre-authorization in lieu of per-invocation asks; see "Tool-use heuristics" in this section for the exact rules.

#### `playwright-browser-operator` (optional live-browser tier)

- **Server:** `playwright`.
- **Install source:** default user-scope MCP template uses `bunx @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated`.
- **Use only from:** `b-browser`, unless the user explicitly invokes another skill and that skill hands off to `b-browser` for browser evidence.
- **Use for:** live page navigation, accessibility snapshots, clicks, typing, form fills, screenshots, tabs, dialogs, console/network inspection, and storage-state assessment when browser/DOM/visual/e2e evidence cannot be satisfied by supplied evidence or existing repo scripts.
- **Default posture:** prefer accessibility snapshots and ordinary browser actions over arbitrary code execution. Do not use unsafe arbitrary-code tools such as `browser_run_code_unsafe` in the default workflow; require explicit approval, a trusted target, and a reason ordinary actions cannot answer the question.
- **State safety:** use ephemeral state by default. Persisted profile, cookie, localStorage, or storage-state reuse requires §6 approval, and real auth/session state must never be stored under a tracked worktree path.

### MCP availability and fallback ladder

Assume bundles are available; do not preflight. On failure, retry once narrower, then fall back and label the limitation.

**Fallback ladder:**
- `serena-symbol-toolkit` unavailable → native Glob/Grep/Read + `apply_patch`. Treat renames and safe-deletes as high-risk; widen verification.
- `gitnexus-radar` unavailable, stale, or missing target → continue without graph evidence; do not retry.
- `context7-docs` unavailable → official-docs URL via `brave-search` + `firecrawl-extraction`.
- `firecrawl-extraction` unavailable on a known URL → search snippets only; mark the answer as snippet-only with `Confidence: low`.
- `firecrawl-extraction` unavailable on a local plain-text, Markdown, or HTML document → use native local reads and exact local tools.
- `firecrawl-extraction` unavailable on a local PDF, spreadsheet, DOCX, or other rich binary → stop with `[degraded: firecrawl-extraction unavailable]`; do not infer substance from filenames or metadata alone.
- `playwright-browser-operator` unavailable → use supplied evidence, existing repo-provided browser/DOM/visual/e2e commands, or known-URL Firecrawl extraction when that can answer the browser evidence question; otherwise label `[degraded: playwright-browser-operator unavailable]` or stop with `cause: tool_unavailable` when no approved evidence path exists.

### Fallback labeling

When fallback changes the intended tool path, evidence source, or verification route, tag the affected step or finding as `[degraded: <reason>]`.

### Tool-use heuristics

- Around **12 MCP calls** in one skill run, pause and summarize remaining unknowns before more discovery.
- Search before extract when the authoritative URL is unknown; extract only the highest-signal source(s) needed for the answer.
- Do not open a second tool-heavy thread until the current investigation, edit, or verification thread is closed or the user asks to expand scope.
- If sustained tool use is not increasing evidence quality, narrow the next check or stop and ask whether to continue.
- Classify failures before retry/fallback: unavailable, auth/permission, rate-limit, timeout, stale index/cache, unsupported content, malformed request. Retry only transient or fixable-by-narrowing failures; stop for auth failures.
- `firecrawl-deep` invocations require user approval **per invocation by default**. **Run-scoped pre-authorization carve-out:** the per-invocation default may be relaxed only when the user issues an explicit, scoped grant (e.g., "approved: use deep mode up to 3 times for this research pass") that names **both** (a) a numeric invocation cap and (b) the current run. Without an explicit cap, the carve-out is invalid and the per-invocation rule still applies. Record the granted cap in the status block `notes` and the handoff envelope `carve-outs` field; decrement on each use and surface the remaining count in the next status block. The carve-out expires when the run ends, when the cap is exhausted, or when the user revokes it — whichever comes first. The carve-out never overrides §6 safety gates (privacy, sensitive files, destructive actions).
- `gitnexus-radar` should usually stay to 1-2 calls per run; more often means the question should move back to Serena or native tools.
- Reuse recently fetched URLs, docs, and symbol results instead of re-fetching them.
- The verification iteration cap (§7) still applies.

### Slash-command flags and modes

When a skill declares flags or modes, parse them before tool use. Unknown flags should not be ignored: ask once or continue only if the intended behavior is still unambiguous. For conflicting flags, prefer the safer or narrower mode and state the choice; if both modes would mutate state or change evidence requirements, ask.

Mode precedence is skill-specific, but the global default is: explicit user flag, explicit user prose, approved plan or handoff, then skill default. When a user requests multiple modes in one run, execute the evidence-gathering mode before the authoring or mutation mode unless the skill says otherwise.

### Run cost signal

When a non-trivial run consumes notable budget, include a one-line cost summary in the status block `notes` field:

`cost: gitnexus=2, serena=14, context7=1, firecrawl-deep=1, iterations=2/3`

Only include counters that were actually used. Skip entirely on trivial runs. This lets the next skill in a chain see whether to slow down before adding more tool work.

### Global bundle/path guards (runtime, not just maintainer norm)

- A skill **must not** invent a new MCP bundle name. Every bundle reference must resolve to a definition in this section.
- A skill **must not** write to a path outside §8. If a use case needs a new path, surface it as a `needs-input` blocker rather than picking one ad hoc.
- A skill **must not** redefine an approval template, fallback label, iteration cap, severity, risk, confidence signal, slug algorithm, run-id format, manifest schema, status block, or handoff envelope. Reference the canonical section.
