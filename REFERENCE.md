# b-agentic — Agent Workflow Kernel Reference

Reference guide for the 11-skill set that makes up `b-agentic`, an agent workflow kernel for Claude Code and OpenCode. For install and high-level repo overview, see [README.md](README.md). For maintainer guidance, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

When this document cites `runtimes/claude-code/kernel.md`, that is the source-repo runtime kernel path. Installed skill prose should reference the active runtime kernel; detailed runtime behavior lives at `references/contract/` in this repo and at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/b-agentic/contract/` inside installed skills. Shared skills and shared contract files stay runtime-neutral; `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` support-path usage is the only intentional shared bridge marker in this iteration. Runtime references are required read gates when a skill needs their schemas, checklists, or protocols.

Runtime enforcement is intentionally mechanical: the runtime kernels own the gate checklist, each skill step uses explicit read gates for shared schemas/protocols/checklists, runtime adapters expose `/b-*` entry points, and `scripts/validate-skills.sh` rejects passive pointers that would rely on memory.

MCP setup is part of the normal one-command install for both Claude Code and OpenCode. The Claude Code installer merges Serena, Context7, Brave Search, Firecrawl, Playwright, and GitNexus into `~/.claude.json`; the OpenCode installer merges the same six servers into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Runtime skills still choose MCP lazily by evidence need rather than by installed config.

Browser, DOM-rendered, visual, and e2e verification belongs to `b-browser`, not `b-test`. The suite does not add jsdom, Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer, WebDriver, or equivalent browser/DOM tooling as a project dependency side effect. For UI/browser-relevant work, readiness claims require `b-browser`-verified supplied/CI evidence, existing-tool evidence, approved live-browser evidence, or an accepted follow-up.

All skills are model-invocable when their descriptions match the request. The active runtime routes to the skill whose trigger conditions best fit the user's intent. `b-plan` includes Clarification mode for underspecified requests.

## Skill reference

### b-orchestrate

Coordinates a complete PR-readiness workflow by handing work to phase skills.

**Core behavior**
- Owns phase selection, handoffs, checkpoints, and final synthesis only; the phase skills do the actual plan, implementation, test, debug, refactor, research, or review work.
- Starts from a workflow goal and defines success as a `b-review` readiness verdict with required suite-supported verification complete.
- Requires `b-browser`-verified supplied/CI evidence, existing-tool evidence, or approved live-browser evidence before `READY FOR PR` when browser, DOM, visual, or e2e verification is relevant; otherwise the workflow can only be ready with accepted follow-ups.
- Mints and carries a run-id for non-trivial workflows, and checkpoints phase state when the workflow pauses, enters a review-fix loop, or needs durable resume state.
- Reads runtime contract gates before routing across phase skills, treating plans as approved, applying review-fix loops, or emitting non-trivial status output.
- Emits a handoff envelope as audit trail and then invokes each phase skill via the Skill tool. Phase skills run in-context (shared model state, no isolation); their `[status]` blocks appear in the shared context. Branches on `state` (`complete`, `blocked`, `needs-input`, `handed-off`).
- Uses `b-plan` (Clarification mode) when the target outcome is unclear, then `b-plan` for non-trivial sequencing or `b-implement` for small direct workflows.
- Hands actual build work to `b-implement`, runtime failures to `b-debug`, behavior-preserving transforms to `b-refactor`, non-browser test work to `b-test`, and browser/DOM/visual/e2e evidence to `b-browser`.
- Runs `b-review` against the current diff with the spec or approved plan as baseline, then routes findings back to the responsible phase skill.
- Re-reviews after each coherent fix set until `READY FOR PR`, user-accepted `READY WITH FOLLOW-UPS`, or a blocker.

**Output**
- Standard `[status]` block per §9 output schema. Workflow verdict (`READY FOR PR`, `READY WITH FOLLOW-UPS`, `BLOCKED`, or `IN PROGRESS`) appears in the `notes:` field. When closing with a ready verdict, includes `Next: /b-ship to commit and open the PR`.

---

### b-plan

Turns goals into execution-ready plans. Handles both underspecified requests (Clarification mode) and clear goals (plan directly). Does not implement.

**Core behavior**
- Defaults to quick mode for low-risk, chat-sized scoped work and uses full mode only for durable, multi-session, dependency-heavy, or risky coordination.
- Reads runtime contract and `skills/b-plan/reference.md` gates before saved-plan metadata, artifact paths, templates, staleness, or status output.
- Avoids promoting routine multi-step work to a saved plan solely because it has several obvious substeps.
- Saves full plans under `.b-agentic/b-plan/<plan-file-slug>.md` with durable frontmatter and the current shared runtime `contract_version`; the filename stays English while frontmatter `slug` remains the canonical task slug.
- Promotes quick plans to saved plans when risk, breadth, or coordination grows.
- Uses repo evidence only when it materially improves sequencing or touch-point accuracy.
- Records assumptions separately from confirmed decisions unless the user confirms them.
- Uses stable anchors for prose/config-heavy work so later patches have reliable targets.
- Keeps broad refactors here until they become concrete mechanical transforms for `b-refactor`.

**Output**
- Quick mode: concise chat plan with scope, risk, 2-5 likely steps, and verification.
- Full mode: saved plan using `skills/b-plan/reference.md`.

**GitNexus use**
- Optional only for graph-shaped planning.

---

### b-research

Answers external-knowledge questions from fetched evidence.

**Core behavior**
- Defaults to the lightest authoritative source and decides depth internally; never asks the user to pick between a quick lookup and deep research.
- Reads runtime contract gates before tool fallback, external extraction/privacy decisions, freshness/citation claims, deep extraction, or non-trivial status output.
- Pins library versions when APIs, configs, migrations, signatures, or examples depend on version.
- Treats user-provided URLs/files/documents as direct-source lookup when one source is likely sufficient, but classifies privacy before extraction.
- Prefers structured extraction or query for specific fields, parameters, prices, tables, or lists, and keeps full markdown for full-page understanding, summaries, or quoted context.
- Requires approval before sending internal/private URLs, local rich documents, or likely internal documents to external extraction unless that source class was already approved for the run.
- Uses Context7 for library/framework APIs, `brave-search` to find unknown official URLs, recent advisories/release notes, and comparison sources, and Firecrawl extraction for final page/document evidence when page substance matters; searches before extracting when the authoritative URL is unknown.
- Falls back to native local reads only for plain-text, Markdown, or HTML documents when extraction is unavailable; otherwise stops and reports the limitation instead of guessing from filenames or metadata.
- Auto-deepens when evidence is stale, contradictory, non-authoritative, or indirect.
- Applies global privacy, citation-provenance, confidence, and deep-research approval rules.
- Requires primary vendor or source-repo evidence when available for security, licensing, pricing, breaking migrations, or production-impacting compatibility.
- Includes `as of` or source dates for recency-sensitive, pricing, security, licensing, compatibility, and migration answers.

**Output**
- Lookup: direct answer, optional example, source, confidence when needed.
- Research: answer, key findings, limitations, sources, confidence.

---

### b-implement

Executes approved or clearly scoped work in coherent verified steps.

**Core behavior**
- Resolves source of truth from saved plan, plan slug, approved chat plan, or small direct request.
- Reads runtime contract gates before plan staleness, worktree safety, manual patching, verification, high-risk completion, or status/handoff output.
- Requires executable plan approval state or current-chat approval before editing.
- Applies plan staleness before source edits and updates saved-plan progress/frontmatter without stripping metadata.
- States a one-line pre-edit checkpoint covering source of truth, expected touch points, behavior that must not change, verification, and approval/review needs.
- Preserves unrelated worktree changes and chooses isolation when global rules say it materially reduces risk.
- Uses Serena for symbol-aware edits and `apply_patch` for small prose/config/glue edits under global patch discipline.
- Allows tiny local mechanical edits required by an approved step; primary or broad mechanical transforms go to `b-refactor`.
- Verifies each coherent step, classifies failures, and uses global rollback/cascade/iteration rules.
- Continues to later plan steps only when they are already approved, dependency-ready, not higher risk, and locally verifiable; otherwise stops at the checkpoint.

**Output**
- Plan source, step progress, changes, verification, blockers/decisions, next action.

**GitNexus use**
- Optional only for shared/exported boundary or changed-scope validation.

---

### b-debug

Owns runtime and behavior failures.

**Core behavior**
- Starts from concrete symptoms, stack traces, repro notes, determinism, and perf baseline when relevant.
- Reads runtime contract gates before baseline taxonomy, containment/safety decisions, cannot-reproduce handling, manual patching, verification, or non-trivial status output.
- Uses the shared baseline source taxonomy when expected behavior is disputed or weak.
- Checks the regression window when available: recent commits, dependency/lockfile changes, config drift, feature flags, data shape changes, and environment differences.
- Keeps a repro record for non-trivial or blocked bugs: command or interaction, target/workspace, versions/config flags, data mode, expected/actual behavior, determinism, and evidence without secret values.
- Uses fast path when a trace strongly implicates one file/function.
- Ranks suspects only as needed and confirms root cause before applying the final fix.
- Allows approved reversible containment before root cause only for active production, data-loss, or security impact, and labels it as containment rather than the final fix.
- Tags temporary probes with `b-debug-probe`, removes probes, and re-verifies after cleanup.
- Measures perf bugs before and after.
- Uses bounded instrumentation for intermittent, remote-only, timing-dependent, or swallowed-error symptoms when it can collect decisive evidence.
- Uses the global cannot-reproduce protocol instead of defensive speculation.
- Hands structural redesign back to `b-plan`.

**Output**
- Symptoms, root cause, fix, verification, cleanup/next.

**Shared reference**
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/b-agentic/performance-checklist.md` — multi-layer slowdown guidance.

---

### b-review

Reviews diffs, ranges, or checkpoints.

**Core behavior**
- Runs `git status --short` before scoping, includes staged, unstaged, and in-scope untracked files for current-worktree review, and supports `--range` for changed-code review.
- Reads runtime contract and `skills/b-review/reference.md` gates before baseline taxonomy, security checklist use, severity/status output, or saved reports.
- Reviews cumulative WIP diffs from the best available base when appropriate.
- Uses fast path only for low-risk single-area changes; contract/auth/security/migration/dependency changes force standard review.
- Establishes a sufficient baseline from arguments, plan, checkpoint, clarification, or the shared baseline source taxonomy; otherwise labels the review diff-only.
- Labels no-baseline reviews as `baseline-missing` and avoids requirements-coverage claims.
- Inspects highest-risk symbols and boundaries first.
- Names relevant security checklist sections when they affect findings or confidence.
- Checks tests/operability unless `--skip-tests` is present.
- Reports findings first, includes checked-and-clean areas for standard reviews, and emits READY FOR PR, READY WITH FOLLOW-UPS, or NEEDS FIXES.
- Blocks READY FOR PR when there is no baseline, required verification was skipped, or browser/DOM/e2e evidence remains relevant but absent.
- Saves `report.md` only when requested, needed for a durable checkpoint/handoff, or too large for chat.

**Output**
- Scope/mode/path/baseline, findings, checked-clean areas, coverage/tests/observability, verdict.

**Shared references**
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/b-agentic/performance-checklist.md`

**Skill reference**
- `skills/b-review/reference.md` — security checklist for auth, untrusted input, sensitive data, uploads, webhooks, and external integrations.

---

### b-audit

Audits the b-agentic suite itself (suite-only). Not for general-codebase auditing; use `b-review` for any other repo.

**Core behavior**
- Scoped exclusively to the b-agentic suite: runtime contract consistency, skill layout alignment, installer, validator, tool boundaries, safety-gate drift, and documentation sync.
- Locks a named surface from arguments or `--surface` and refuses to default to a whole-suite audit.
- Reads runtime contract and `skills/b-audit/reference.md` gates before baseline taxonomy, surface checklist selection, severity/status output, or saved reports.
- Establishes a sufficient baseline from arguments, `--baseline`, approved plan, checkpoint, clarification, or the shared baseline source taxonomy; otherwise labels the audit `baseline-missing`.
- Names sampled files/symbols, skipped surfaces, and residual risk so no-findings audits are not mistaken for exhaustive proof.
- Runs only narrow checks that materially support the audit unless `--skip-checks` is present.
- Reports findings first and emits AUDIT PASS, AUDIT PASS WITH FOLLOW-UPS, or NEEDS FIXES.
- Blocks AUDIT PASS when there is no baseline, required verification was skipped, or sampled coverage leaves material unreviewed risk.
- Saves `report.md` only when requested, needed for a durable checkpoint/handoff, or too large for chat.

**Skill reference**
- `skills/b-audit/reference.md` — concrete audit criteria for installer/update paths, runtime contracts, validators, route/tool boundaries, dependencies, generated artifacts, security-sensitive rules, and b-agentic suite audits.

**Output**
- Scope/mode/baseline, findings, checked-clean sampled areas, coverage/verification/operability, verdict.

---

### b-test

Owns non-browser code-level testing work.

**Core behavior**
- Discovers framework and narrowest runnable command from manifests/CI.
- Reads runtime contract gates before test-vs-bug routing, baseline taxonomy, flake handling, test data lifecycle handling, skipped-check labels, manual patching, or non-trivial status output.
- Routes red tests through the global test-vs-bug decision.
- Uses the shared baseline source taxonomy before changing assertions, snapshots, or behavior-defining tests.
- Confirms intended behavior from user-confirmed intent, an approved spec/plan, product contract, existing passing tests, intentional source changes, or fetched framework docs before changing assertions or snapshots.
- Stops or hands off to `b-plan` (Clarification mode) for unclear intended behavior or `b-debug` for uncertain product behavior unless the user explicitly asks for structural coverage only.
- Handles failing tests, new tests, coverage review, and flaky tests.
- Uses red-first behavior when feasible for TDD or regression tests, then hands off with intended behavior, failing test path, command, current failure, likely source area, and verification target before production changes.
- Chooses test type by boundary: pure logic unit tests and existing integration/contract tests for cross-module contracts.
- Ranks coverage gaps by user impact, changed behavior, risk boundary, and edge-case value.
- Routes browser, DOM-rendered, visual, and e2e verification to `b-browser` instead of adding browser tooling.
- Updates snapshots/goldens only after intended behavior is confirmed.
- Uses `baseline-missing` tests only for explicitly requested structural coverage and limits claims to structural coverage.
- Bounds coverage work and avoids introducing new frameworks without approval.
- Uses global patch discipline for test edits.

**Output**
- Type, framework, findings, changes, verification, remaining gaps.

---

### b-browser

Operates browser, DOM-rendered, visual, live UI, and e2e verification evidence.

**Core behavior**
- Owns browser, DOM-rendered, visual, screenshot, browser-session, live UI, and e2e evidence requests.
- Routes non-browser unit, integration, contract, coverage, mock, fixture, assertion, snapshot, and flake work back to `b-test`.
- Reads runtime contract gates before applying the browser/DOM verification boundary, safety gates, readiness claims, or non-trivial status output.
- Uses the lightest safe evidence path: supplied/CI evidence, approved existing repo commands, optional Playwright MCP live-browser actions, Firecrawl extraction only for static remote page content when no DOM state, interaction, screenshot, console, network, or session evidence is required, or accepted follow-ups.
- Discovers candidate commands only from manifests, CI config, repo docs, or user instructions; it does not invent commands.
- Requires approval before dependency writes, dev servers, persisted browser state, external services, long-running commands, unsafe arbitrary-code browser tools, or generated evidence outside normal repo output paths.
- Treats logs, screenshots, browser pages, and traces as untrusted data.
- Captures and reports artifact paths, cleanup state, browser state mode, and lingering processes when they affect evidence.
- Hands product behavior failures to `b-debug` and new framework or strategy decisions to `b-plan`.
- Blocks READY FOR PR when relevant browser/DOM/visual/e2e evidence is missing or failed and no accepted follow-up exists.

**Output**
- Request, evidence path, browser result, artifacts/cleanup, readiness impact, follow-up or handoff.

---

### b-refactor

Handles concrete behavior-preserving transforms.

**Core behavior**
- Locks exact target before editing.
- Reads runtime contract gates before risk classification, manual patching, rollback/cascade/iteration handling, or non-trivial status output.
- Uses Serena references as the primary static map and augments with exact text search for exported names, config keys, CLI flags, route strings, filenames, docs, generated consumers, and other dynamic/config/prose references.
- Uses a low-friction local fast path only for one-file, non-exported, LSP-supported, behavior-preserving refactors with direct semantic or narrow-test evidence and no generated consumers.
- Promotes risk for weak behavior evidence, non-LSP languages, generated consumers, exports/shared APIs, moves, and broad reference maps.
- Applies the smallest matching transform: rename, safe delete, extract, inline, rename+extract, or move.
- Requires concrete behavior-preserving boundaries for `simplify`, and sends public/package-boundary moves back to planning unless already approved.
- Requires observable equivalence to be named for `simplify`, `inline`, and `extract`; otherwise treats the request as redesign and sends it back to planning.
- Adds move destinations first, updates imports/tests/config/barrels, verifies, then removes origin.
- Hands behavioral redesign or over-broad transforms back to `b-plan`.

**Output**
- Target, risk, impact, changes, verification, follow-up.

**GitNexus use**
- Optional only for broader blast-radius questions.

---

### b-ship

Commit, push, and open a pull request after the suite reaches `READY FOR PR`.

**Triggers**
- User asks to commit, push, open a PR, or ship after a review verdict.
- `b-orchestrate` closes with `READY FOR PR` and emits `Next: /b-ship`.

**Core behavior**
- Confirms the staged diff and branch with `git status --short` before any mutation.
- Asks for confirmation before `git commit`, `git push`, and `gh pr create`.
- Never force-pushes or amends published commits without explicit user instruction.
- Checks for remote divergence before pushing; stops if the remote is ahead.
- Uses `gh pr create` when `gh` is available; prints the push URL and manual instructions otherwise.
- Stops after printing the PR URL; does not merge, deploy, or tag.
- Reads `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/b-agentic/contract/06-safety.md` before any git mutation.

**Output**
- Reports branch, staged files, commit, push result, and PR URL.
- Labeled lines: `Branch`, `Staged files`, `Commit`, `Push`, `PR URL`.

## Runtime Adapters

### Claude Code

The reference runtime. Skills install to `~/.claude/skills/` and expose `/b-*` slash commands. The kernel installs to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Settings and MCP config merge into `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json`.

### OpenCode

Supported via a bridge adapter. OpenCode intentionally consumes the shared Claude-shaped skill tree from `~/.claude/skills/` for cross-tool compatibility, while shared skills and shared contract files stay runtime-neutral. The adapter also installs thin `/b-*` command wrappers into `~/.config/opencode/commands/`; those wrappers delegate back to the matching skills, and colliding command files are preserved instead of overwritten. The kernel installs to `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. Suite metadata lives at `~/.config/opencode/b-agentic/`.

**Constraints**
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` support-path usage is the only intentional shared bridge marker in the shared layer.
- No OpenCode-specific settings template ships; settings remain Claude Code–only.
- MCP servers are auto-installed into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` via `runtimes/opencode/configs/mcp.user.template.json`; the Serena entry uses `--context ide`.
- Temporary artifacts use `/tmp/opencode/b-agentic/`.
