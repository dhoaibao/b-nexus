# Runtime Adapter Scaffold

This scaffold documents the minimum adapter-owned files a new runtime should provide.

It is intentionally not listed in `runtimes/registry.yaml`, so validation, smoke coverage, rendering, and install flows ignore it until a real runtime is added.

## How to use it

1. Copy `runtimes/runtime-template/` to `runtimes/<name>/`.
2. Add the new runtime entry to `runtimes/registry.yaml`.
3. Rerun `python3 tooling/generate/registry_sync.py` so `runtimes/<name>/kernel.md` renders from `references/contract/kernel.template.md`.
4. Replace every placeholder in `configs/README.md`, `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/validate.sh`, and `tests/smoke.sh`.
5. Update `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and any adapter-specific docs in the same change.
6. Run `bash scripts/validate-skills.sh` and `bash scripts/smoke-install.sh`.

## Required adapter-owned surfaces

- `configs/README.md` documents runtime layout, config shape, and adapter caveats.
- `scripts/install.sh` is the thin runtime driver sourced by `install.sh`.
- `scripts/validate.sh` checks adapter-only invariants.
- `tests/smoke.sh` registers the runtime's smoke lane for `tests/smoke/install.sh`.

The root wrappers stay stable. Adding a runtime should not require editing `scripts/validate-skills.sh`, `scripts/smoke-install.sh`, or the shared installer architecture.
